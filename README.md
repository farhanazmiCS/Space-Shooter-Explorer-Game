# INF1009 Group 9 Team Project

## Part 1: Game Engine

### Requirements

1. Simulation Lifecycle Management 
2. Application should open, initialize, load content, draw content and update (Main class)
3. Collision Management and Detection (Logic when collision happens)
4. Behavior Management
5. Input Management
6. Entity Managers (Movement, creation, drawing, rendering, destruction of entities. . For example, think of the methods/functions that allow for the entity to be created, rendered, moved, or deleted)
7. Screen/Scene Managers 
8. Transitions between scenes, scenes include start screen, instruction screen, leaderboard, game play screen and overlays such as menus, scoreboards, etc
9. Lifecycle Managers (Process the game, from the START to the END)
    - Entities should be created, initialised, loaded, drawn, deleted (if required) and updated
    
### What needs to be showcased

- Need to showcase a prototype to demonstrate the game engine technology and
game mechanics
- Proper usage of OOP concepts
- Classes
- Objects 
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Error Handling
- Re-usablilty of code
- Modularity
- Functionalities
- Various features of the game
- UML diagram
  - Identify the main entities to create classes
  - Think how you want to structure and connect these classes
- Code
- Store code in a repository (Git/Github)
- Collaborate with your team-mates
- Use it for the entire project
- Code Structure
- File, class and function naming convention should be followed (they should be self explanatory)

### Things to submit:
- Report
- Code
- Weekly updates on progress???
- Presentation Slides
- Video Demo (Not more than 8 mins)
  - Show innovation and functionalities
    
## Part 2: Actual Game

### Project Theme: Space Exploration

Current Ideas: 
- Fun Fact Game?  Pop up for funfact?
- Trivia? (e.g. how to be a millionaire)
- Badges (Achievements ?)
- Boxhead:	
  - Answer trivia qns for blocks/health etc
  - Top down shooter, but exploratory in nature (e.g., many levels, or “environment/planets” to explore”. 
  - Player can decide on which path/environment to take/visit
  - Player can then defeat the “boss” in each room to get more information on each planet
